Peter is a postgraduate researcher in his 3rd year of a PhD.
Graduating from the University of Bristol with a bachelorsâ€™ in Mechanical Engineering, he then went on to work on a feasibility study sponsored by Airbus focused on the analysis of engineering drawings. He started his PhD in 2017 within the [Design and Manufacturing Futures Lab](https://dmf-lab.co.uk/peter-rosso/), working on refactoring of CAD models.

Outside of engineering, he is a keen climber and mountaineer. Mountain Leader trained, and he is currently on his Rock Climbing Instructor qualification. Peter's love for climbing is fuelled from going climbing in the local Avon Gorge, and mountaineering in the Alps where his family lives. Last summer he took part in a [climbing expedition in Armenia](https://www.projectarmenia.co.uk/) and presented his personal experience at the [Royal Geographical Society](https://www.rgs.org/geography/online-lectures/project-armenia-climbing-above-the-clouds-peter/).
